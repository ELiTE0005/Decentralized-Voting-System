# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
Technologies Used in a Decentralized Voting Platform
Blockchain – Provides a tamper-proof, immutable ledger for recording votes.

Ethereum (for smart contracts using Solidity)
Hyperledger Fabric (for permissioned blockchain voting)
Polygon / Solana (for faster, lower-cost transactions)
Smart Contracts – Automates vote casting and tallying securely.

Solidity (for Ethereum-based contracts)
Rust (for Solana-based contracts)
Chaincode (for Hyperledger Fabric)
Cryptographic Techniques – Ensures voter privacy and vote integrity.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) (e.g., zk-SNARKs) for anonymous voting
Homomorphic Encryption for secure vote tallying
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for secure digital signatures
Decentralized Identity (DID) & Authentication – Prevents voter fraud.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) using uPort, Sovrin, or Microsoft ION
OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect for authentication
Biometric Verification (Face ID, Fingerprint)
Consensus Mechanisms – Ensures integrity and agreement of votes.

Proof of Stake (PoS) (Ethereum 2.0, Cardano)
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) (EOS, Tron)
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) (Hyperledger Fabric)
Frontend Development – User interface for casting votes.

React.js / Next.js (for web-based voting portals)
Flutter / React Native (for mobile applications)
Backend & APIs – Handles authentication and blockchain interactions.

Node.js / Express.js (for server-side processing)
Python (Flask / Django) (for integrating AI-driven fraud detection)
GraphQL / REST APIs (for data communication)
Decentralized Storage – Stores voting records securely.

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
Arweave
Filecoin
Governance & DAO – Manages election rules transparently.

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) Frameworks
Aragon / DAOstack for community governance
